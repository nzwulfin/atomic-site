geard is a command line client for installing
https://www.docker.io[Docker] images as containers onto a
systemd-enabled Linux operating system (systemd 207 or newer). It may be
run as a command:

---------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo gear install pmorie/sti-html-app my-sample-service
---------------------------------------------------------

to install the public image pmorie/sti-html-app to systemd on the local
machine with the service name "ctr-my-sample-service". The command can
also start as a daemon and serve API requests over HTTP (default port
43273) :

--------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo gear daemon
2014/02/21 02:59:42 ports: searching block 41, 4000-4099
2014/02/21 02:59:42 Starting HTTP on :43273 ...
--------------------------------------------------------

The `gear` CLI can connect to this agent:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ gear stop localhost/my-sample-service
$ gear install pmorie/sti-html-app localhost/my-sample-service.1 localhost/my-sample-service.2
$ gear start localhost/my-sample-service.1 localhost/my-sample-service.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The geard agent exposes operations on containers needed for
https://github.com/openshift/geard/blob/master/docs/orchestrating_geard.md[large
scale orchestration] in production environments, and tries to map those
operations closely to the underlying concepts in Docker and systemd. It
supports linking containers into logical groups (applications) across
multiple hosts with
https://github.com/openshift/geard/blob/master/docs/linking.md[iptables
based local networking], shared environment files, and SSH access to
containers. It is also a test bed for prototyping related container
services that may eventually exist as Docker plugins, such as routing,
event notification, and efficient idling and network activation.

The gear daemon and local commands must run as root to interface with
the Docker daemon over its Unix socket and systemd over DBus.
