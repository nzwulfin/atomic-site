Cockpit
=======
**A remote manager for GNU/Linux servers**

* Cockpit is a server manager that makes it easy to administer your GNU/Linux servers via a web browser.

* Cockpit makes it easy for any sysadmin to perform simple tasks, such as administering storage, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

* Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in the terminal, it can be seen in the Cockpit journal interface.

* You can monitor and administer several servers at the same time. Just add them with a single click and your machines will look after its buddies.

## Cockpit and Docker

Cockpit also makes it easy to monitor and administer Docker containers running on Cockpit-managed servers such as Project Atomic hosts.

* Monitor resources consumed by containers
* Adjust resources available to containers
 * Resource limits enforced by the CGroup subsystem in the Linux kernel
 * Adjust CPU shares
 * Assign memory limits
 * More CGroup policy controls to come
* Stop, Start, Delete and Commit container instances
* Run and Delete container images

## Starting and Using Cockpit

1. After starting your atomic host, you need to run the `cockpit` container:
    * `$ sudo atomic run cockpit/ws`
2. You can now use the `cockpit` management interface at `http://yourhost:9090`

For information on adding a systemd service file to ensure that the cockpit/ws container runs on system startup, see [this blog post](/blog/2015/06/running-cockpit-as-a-service/), and see [this post](/blog/2015/08/running-a-containerized-cockpit-ui-from-cloud-init/) to learn how to run cockpit via cloud-init.
