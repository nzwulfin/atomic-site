Project Atomic Quick Start Guide
--------------------------------

We recommend reading the Getting Started Guide and Concepts Guide if
you're entirely new to the concept of Atomic and Docker. But, we also
wanted to provide a *Quick Start Guide* (or "guide for the impatient")
for folks who just want to plow through and see what all the fuss is
about.

[[what-you-need]]
What You Need
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* *A virtualization client.* http://virt-manager.org/[Virtual Machine
Manager] (virt-manager) is a very good KVM-based client for Linux
systems. Windows and OS X users can give
https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] a try. Be sure your
virtualization client is properly configured to access the Internet.
* *A virtual machine image.* Images for Atomic hosts are produced by
both the Fedora Project and the CentOS Project. Downloads for these
images can be found via the [Downloads page]
(http://www.projectatomic.io/download/) in QCOW2, RAW, and Vagrant BOX
formats.
* *Note for VirtualBox users* At the moment, we are not producing native
VirtualBox images, but you can generate your own VirtualBox image from
the qcow2 images with `qemu-img`:

----------------------------------------------------------------
qemu-img convert -f qcow2 [filename].qcow2 -O vdi [filename].vdi
----------------------------------------------------------------

[[step-by-step]]
Step by Step
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three basic steps we'll do for each virtualization provider
before booting the virtual machine:

1.  Prep the cloud-init source ISO
2.  Create the Atomic host virtual machine
3.  Add and configure storage for Docker

[[prep-the-cloud-init-source-iso]]
Prep the cloud-init source ISO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to pass run time customizations to an Atomic host, we use
cloud-init. +
You will need to create a metadata ISO to supply critical data via
http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/[*cloud-init*] when your host
boots. You can pass system data via `meta-data` and configuration data
via `user-data` files. We will be setting up the password and adding an
ssh key for the default user. The metatdata ISO is created on the
machine running your virtualization provider.

1.  Create a `meta-data` file with your desired hostname and any
instance-id.
+
------------------------------------
$ cat meta-data
instance-id: atomic-host001
local-hostname: atomic01.example.org
------------------------------------
2.  Create a `user-data` file. The #cloud-config directive at the
beginning of the file is mandatory, not a comment. If you have multiple
admins and ssh keys you'd like to access the default user, you can add a
new `ssh-rsa` line. The
+
-----------------------------------------------------------
$ cat user-data
#cloud-config
password: atomic
ssh_pwauth: True
chpasswd: { expire: False }

ssh_authorized_keys:
  - ssh-rsa ... foo@bar.baz (insert ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub here)
-----------------------------------------------------------
3.  After creating the `user-data` and `meta-data` files, generate an
ISO file. Make sure the user running libvirt has the proper permissions
to read the generated image.
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ genisoimage -output init.iso -volid cidata -joliet -rock user-data meta-data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll add this ISO as a CD-ROM device in the virtual machine.

[[create-the-atomic-host-virtual-machine]]
Create the Atomic host virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll start with the QCOW2 format image for both virt-manager and
VirtualBox. For virt-manager, you will use this image directly. For
VirtualBox, convert the QCOW2 to VDI in order to create an image
suitable for VirtualBox.

----------------------------------------------------------------
qemu-img convert -f qcow2 [filename].qcow2 -O vdi [filename].vdi
----------------------------------------------------------------

[[creating-with-virt-manager]]
Creating with virt-manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's how to get started with Atomic on your machine using virt-manager
on Linux. The instructions below are for running virt-manager on Fedora
21. The steps may vary slightly when running older distributions of
virt-manager.

1.  Select `File` -> `New Virtual Machine` from the menu bar. The New VM
dialog box will open.
2.  Select the Import existing disk image option and click Forward. The
next page in the New VM dialog will appear.
3.  Click `Browse`. The Locate or create storage volume dialog will
open.
4.  Click `Browse Local`. The Locate existing storage dialog will open.
5.  Navigate to the downloaded virtual machine file, select it, and
click `Open`.
6.  In the New VM dialog, select `Linux` for the OS type, `Fedora 21`
(or later) for the Version, and click `Forward`.
7.  Adjust the VM's RAM and CPU settings (if needed) and click
`Forward`.
8.  Select the checkbox next to `Customize configuration before install`
and click `Forward`. This will allow you to add the metatdata ISO device
before booting the VM.

**Note**: When running virt-manager on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or
CentOS 6, the VM *will not boot* until the disk storage format is
changed from raw to qcow2.

[[adding-the-cd-rom-device-for-the-metadata-source]]
Adding the CD-ROM device for the metadata source
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  In the virt-manager GUI, click to open your Atomic machine. Then on
the top bar click _View > Details_
2.  Click on _Add Hardware_ on the bottom left corner.
3.  Choose __Storage__, and __Select managed or other existing
storage__. Browse and select the `init.iso` image you created. Change
the _Device type_ to CD-ROM device. Click on _Finish_ to create and
attach this storage.

[[creating-with-virtualbox]]
Creating with VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's how to get started with Atomic on your machine using VirtualBox
on Windows, OS X, or Linux.

1.  Click the New icon on the VirtualBox toolbar. The Create Virtual
Machine dialog box will open.
2.  Enter a name for the new machine, select `Linux` for the Type,
`Fedora (64 bit)` for the Version, and click `Next`.
3.  Adjust the VM's RAM if needed and click `Next`.
4.  Select the `Use an existing virtual hard drive` option, browse to
the file location, and click `Create`. The virtual machine will be
created and the virtual machine will be ready.

[[adding-the-cd-rom-device-for-the-metadata-source-1]]
Adding the CD-ROM device for the metadata source
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  In the VirtualBox GUI, click _Settings_ for you Atomic virtual
machine.
2.  On the _Storage_ tab, for the IDE Controller, __Add CD/DVD Device__.
3.  Select __Choose Disk__, and select the `init.iso` you created.

[[exploring-the-atomic-host]]
Exploring the Atomic host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boot the virtual machine with the CD-ROM attached and cloud-init will
populate the default user information with the password or SSH keys you
provided in the `user-data` file. *For a Fedora image, the default user
is `fedora`, for CentOS the default user is `centos`.*

Once you've booted and logged in to your Atomic host, you can update the
system software with `$ sudo rpm-ostree upgrade` to pull in any updates.

[[add-and-configure-storage-for-docker]]
Add and configure storage for Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Docker is ready to go at this point, but there's another fairly
important bit of config to do, if you're going to be testing out more
than a couple containers--you need to add a bigger drive for the docker
LVM thin pool.

[[add-a-new-drive-in-virt-manager]]
Add A New Drive in virt-manager
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Select the View, Details menu command on your VM window.
2.  Click the Add Hardware. The Add New Virtual Hardware dialog box will
open.
3.  Select Storage, change disk size to what you want, change bus type
to VirtIO, and click Finish. The Add New Virtual Hardware dialog box
will close.

[[add-a-new-drive-in-virtualbox]]
Add A New Drive in VirtualBox
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  With the Atomic VM closed, select the Machine, Settings menu
command. The Settings dialog box will open.
2.  Select the Storage option. The Storage settings will appear.
3.  Select the Controller for the VM and click the Add Hard Disk icon. A
Question dialog will open.
4.  Choose Create New Disk. The Create Virtual Hard Drive dialog box
will open.
5.  Follow the steps 7-10 above used in creating a new VirtualBox VM to
make a new hard drive for the VirtualBox VM.

[[configuring-the-new-drive]]
Configuring the New Drive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Run `$ sudo fdisk -l` to find name of your new disk (e.g., /dev/vdb)
2.  Open `/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup` in an editor
3.  Add the new disk by creating a `DEVS` entry. If you added more than
one, you can add more to the list separated by a space.
+
---------------
DEVS="/dev/vdb"
---------------
4.  If you'd like to use some of the space on the new disk to grow the
root volume, you can create a `ROOT_SIZE` with the new total size.
+
------------
ROOT_SIZE=4G
------------
5.  Run `$ sudo docker-storage-setup` to run the helper script and
configure the thin pool. This tool calculates the amount of available
space, what's needed for the metadata pool, and executes the LVM
commands.
6.  Run `$ sudo docker info` to make sure that the Docker daemon sees
the added space.
7.  If you added space to the root volume, run `$ sudo xfs_growfs /` to
make sure the filesystem gets expanded to match the volume size.
8.  If you added space to the root volume, run `df -Th` to make sure
that the root volume has been grown to the new total size.
