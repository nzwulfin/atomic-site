Operating System Upgrades via rpm-ostree
----------------------------------------

Project Atomic features a new update system for operating systems called
`rpm-ostree`. In the default model, the RPMs are composed on a server
into an OSTree repository, and client systems can replicate in an
image-like fashion, including incremental updates.

Unlike traditional operating system update mechanisms, it will
automatically keep the previous version of the OS, always available for
rollback.

Upgrading a Machine with rpm-ostree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply invoke `rpm-ostree upgrade`. It checks the repository URL
specified in `/ostree/repo/config` to check for an updated version.

If a new version is found, it will first be downloaded, then deployed.
At that point, a three-way merge of configuration is performed, using
the new `/etc` as a base, and applying your changes on top.

After an update is prepared, you should `systemctl reboot` to cause the
updates to take effect.

[[rollback-to-the-previous-tree]]
Rollback to the Previous Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, you always have a previous tree (an operating system
snapshot) installed. So if something goes wrong, you can always fall
back to the previous tree. The previous tree is available as a
bootloader entry; to access the previous tree, hold down SHIFT during OS
bootup and select the fallback tree in the bootloader menu.

If you boot into the new tree and determine that something is wrong, you
can invoke `rpm-ostree rollback`.
