    %strong Project Atomic introduces Atomic App
    &mdash; an implementation of the 
    #{link_to "Nulecule", "/docs/nulecule"}
    specification, which lets you manage multi-container applications and

          Atomic App
        %p
          With Atomic App, you can use existing containers as building 
          blocks for your new application product or project.
      
        %p
          Databases, web servers, and other common components are
          vital parts of applications and services. Utilizing existing
          containers to provide these core infrastructure components lets 
          you focus more on building the stuff that matters and less time
          packaging and setting up the common plumbing required.

            [Nulecule is a made-up word](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Made-up_words#N)
            meaning "the mother of all atomic particles". Sounds like "molecule". 
            But different.

            Also a specification for applications composed from
