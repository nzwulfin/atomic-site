%h1 Get Started with Atomic

%h2 Download an Atomic Host image

%img.pull-right( src="/images/platforms.png")

%p.lead
  Atomic Host images are provided by the Fedora and the CentOS Projects.
%p
The <a href="http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic">CentOS
Atomic SIG</a> offers a rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic
Host, considered a stable target.

The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Cloud_SIG">Fedora Cloud SIG</a> offers a new Fedora product Atomic Cloud Image.

%p
  The "QCOW2" image works on Linux KVM virtualization, for example it runs on
  <a href="http://openstack.redhat.com/">RDO</a> (OpenStack),
  <a href="http://ovirt.org">oVirt</a>,
  <a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-manager</a> and
  the "Boxes" virtual machine application available in
  <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> and <a href="http://centos.org/">CentOS 7</a>.
%p
  Both the Fedora and CentOS Atomic Host images are also available in Vagrant format, for use with the VirtualBox and libvirt/KVM providers, as well as in AMI format for running in EC2, and as ISO images for bare-metal installations.

    %h2 Set Up the Virtual Machine

    %p
      Please follow the
      %a( href="/docs/quickstart/" ) Quick Start Guide
      to create a new virtual machine with Atomic and set
      up more disk space for your containers.  This guide will set up a single host capable of running Docker containers.

    %h2 Configure an Atomic cluster

    %p
      Atomic hosts are either used in a standalone configuration to run Docker containers or in an orchestrated cluster to run Kubernetes pods.
      You can use the
      %a( href="/docs/gettingstarted" ) Getting Started Guide
      to set up a cluster.  You can run a standalone configuration after completing the Quick Start guide.

    %h3 Extremely Quick Start Guide For the Impatient

    %p
      From here in, we'll refer to the Atomic VM as the "host," even though it's actually a VM. Atomic boots to a text console, asking you to log in.
      You need to create a metadata ISO for use with <a href="http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">cloud-init</a>.

      For example instructions on creating one, see:
      %a( href="/blog/2014/10/getting-started-with-cloud-init/" ) this blog entry.

    %h4 Atomic Upgrades

    %p
      From a running host, start an upgrade with:
    %pre
      \# atomic host upgrade
      \# systemctl reboot
    %p
      On the boot screen you'll see your new version. Hold down the
      SHIFT key there to rollback to your previous tree.

    %h4 Docker Containers

    %p
      Host applications on Atomic with #{link_to "Docker", "https://www.docker.io"}
    %pre
      :preserve
        # docker run fedora /bin/echo "hello world"
    %p
      Get familiar with the #{link_to "Docker tutorial", "https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#"}, then
      learn how you can build reusable images and run Docker in production on Atomic hosts.

    %h4 Try the New UI for Your Server

    %p
      Administer the services on your system with Cockpit (Preview - not for production use)

    %pre
      :preserve
        # atomic run cockpit/ws
        # visit http://&lt;ipaddress&gt;:9090 in a browser
    %p
      Cockpit is perfect for new sysadmins, allowing them to easily perform simple tasks such as storage
      administration, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

    %p
      Cockpit runs inside a privileged container and is able to monitor and
      administer several servers at the same time. Each server only needs
      ```cockpit-bridge``` and ```cockpit-shell```, which are part of Fedora
      Atomic 22, in order to get connected to Cockpit.

    %h4 Learn about Kubernetes

    %p
      If you're looking to work with orchestration, you'll want
      to get started with Kubernetes.

    %p
      The "Atomic fleet concepts" portion of our Getting Started
      guide will walk you through configuring a Kubernetes cluster.

    %h2 Virtual Machines

    %p
      Virtualization on your own computer is an easy option to get
      started, but it also works great for container development.

    %p
      We have images and instructions for the most common platforms:
      KVM/QEmu, OpenStack, VMWare and Vagrant.

    %p

      If there is no ready-to-run appliance image for your platform,
      as a fallback you can install Atomic with the installer ISO
      image.

    %h2 Public Cloud Providers

    %p

      Project Atomic images are available on most common public cloud
      providers, ready to run.

    %p

      We have preloaded images available for Amazon EC2 and Rackspace
      cloud. For other compatible cloud providers you can upload the
      provided image yourself, or use the installer ISO.

    %h2 Your Own Hardware

    %p

      Atomic can be installed on most 64 bit X86 computers. Actual
      hardware requirements depend on your use case.

    %p

      If we must give a number to compare against, I would guess 256
      megabytes of memory would be a minimum for testing and
      experimenting with Atomic.
